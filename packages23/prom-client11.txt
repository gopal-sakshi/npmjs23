Golden signals of monitoring

latency
- time it takes to service a request
- break latency by ----> latency of successful requests & failed requests

traffic
- how much demand is being placed on your system
- number of HTTP requests per second
    break the traffic by ----> serving === static content vs dynamic content

errors
- rate of requests that fail
- HTTP 500s; HTTP 200 but wrong content

saturation
- how full your service is
- memory constrained (or) I/O constrained
- can you service handle 
    double the traffic; handle only 10% more traffic
